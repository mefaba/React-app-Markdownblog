No one's rhyming about spinach.\n\nHere is a description of this heavenly nectar from wikipedia on [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream): \n\n> Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)is\n> a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or \n> dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, \n> cashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a \n> sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, \n> such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in \n> addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to \n> incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point \n> of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. \n> The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at \n> very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes \n> more malleable as its temperature increases."}]
